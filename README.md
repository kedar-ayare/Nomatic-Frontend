## The submission is divided in 2 Git Repos.

[Frontend](https://github.com/kedar-ayare/Nomatic-Frontend)

[Backend](https://github.com/kedar-ayare/Nomatic-Backend)

The submission is made using React-Native, NodeJS + ExpressJS, MongoDB Atlas.

To try use the app, download the .apk file in the Frontend Repo, pull both repo in your local machine. 

Use **"npm start"** to start the development server and add your's device's **IPv4 address** in the add's debug menu's Bundel Location along with **":8081"** as the developement server runs on the port 8081.

Use **"nodemon index.js"** to start the Node server which would run on port **3000**.

I have used a third party tool called **[NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)** that helps in tunnelling the port 3000, so that we can access the backend eventhough it's running on local machine. The link from NGROK should be added to the **"data.js"** file in **"utilities"** module in Frontend Repo.
